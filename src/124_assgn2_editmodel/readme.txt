From CS124 Winter Quarter 2018 Assignment 2. The only code that was my work was EditModel (which generates the candidates)
and StupidBackoffLanguageModel (which chooses the best candidate based off of a (very bad) statistical model).

EditModel and SpellCorrect both have a __main__ function. EditModel performs a small sanity check on candidate generation, while 
SpellCorrect is a test harness for full spelling correction, integrating a custom language model.

Requires running in the same directory as the contents of data/124_assign2_editmodel.
